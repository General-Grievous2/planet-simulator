# Planet Simulator

## Comprehensive Documentation

### Features
- Simulate the gravitational effects between different celestial bodies.
- Visual representation of planetary orbits.
- Customizable parameters for mass, velocity, and distance.

### Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/General-Grievous2/planet-simulator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd planet-simulator
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any) and run the simulator:
   ```bash
   <run-instructions>
   ```

### Physics Implementation
- Utilizes Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation.
- Integration techniques to calculate motion over time.

### Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the simulation.
- `assets/`: Includes images and data files.
- `docs/`: Documentation files related to the project.

### Customization
- Modify `config.json` for initial settings:
  - Change gravitational constants.
  - Adjust visual settings.

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Check error logs in the terminal for specific issues.

### Educational Value
- Learn fundamental physics concepts through interactive simulation.
- Understand the complexity of celestial mechanics and orbital dynamics.
